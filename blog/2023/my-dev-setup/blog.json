        "text-2": "There are many Linux distros to choose from (sorry windows folks). Previously, I used Ubuntu for 4 years and the experience was great. Currently, I am using Fedora 38. They both have GNOME desktop env and I’m a huge fan of GNOME. The main reason behind this was that Ubuntu tweaked GNOME a lot more than I wanted it to and added its own theme; yaru. But, I like the stock GNOME look & feel which uses the adwaita theme. And, the fedora repos are much more updated than ubuntu.",
        "text-3": "So which distro should you use?. It depends on your personal preference honestly. If you are new to the Linux world then I recommend Ubuntu, Pop OS or Zorin OS, because these distros are beginner friendly, and most of the necessary packages are pre-installed. Both Pop OS & Zorin are based on Ubuntu with a bit of customizations on top of it. You can try these distros and make your selection, And if you are experienced in Linux then you know what to use.",
